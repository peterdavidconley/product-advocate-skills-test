        <h2>Peter Conley Product Advocate Application<h2>
        <p>
          1. Things a Product Advocate Might Do:
          Here are the things a product advocate at Vercel might do in no particular order. 
    
          List the 3 things you would be most interested in doing:

          • Create Salesforce reports to keep track of data pertinent to the team or your stats Hop on a Zoom call to do a product demo	
          • Research and organize notes to ensure Account Executives are prepared for calls
          • Write direct and concise emails that dig into a prospect's pain points and needs 
    
          3 you would be least interested in doing:
    
          • Evaluate OSS sponsorship applications
          • Evaluate an application to help determine if it's commercial or not
          • Attend weekly enablement meetings to level up your product and sales knowledge
         </p>
         <p>
          2. Reflection on past experience:	
    
          a. In your next role, what are you looking to learn or do more of?
	  
	  Become more technically advanced and a better writer.
							
          b. Which (non-Vercel) technical or sales article, guide or lightning talk left the biggest positive impression on you? Why? (and please provide             the link)

         3. Using Next.js
  
         Add a temporary redirect to your Next/Vercel project
							
         Add a temporary in-app redirect to your project by redirecting /hello-vercel (or any path – but be sure to tell us which!) to https://vercel.com

         </p>

          4. Practice Email Responses
